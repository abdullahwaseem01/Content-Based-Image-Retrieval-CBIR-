# MNIST-Image-Recognition
## 1. Introduction

Generally, searching for an image in a set database is typically done through something known as Content-Based Imaged Retrieval (CBIR). Content-Based Image Retrieval works with the image itself rather than assigning specific text or data to it to search for it. Earlier CBIR systems identified a certain image by its description of visual characteristics like color, shape, texture, and other significant physical details. In 2015, an idea was proposed to use Radon barcode for image retrieval system in the medical field [3]. This was inspired by the many other products that use barcodes in some shape or form. Radon barcode is binary code that is generated by Radon Transformation and uses projection angles to tag an image. Using Radon barcodes is much more efficient than previous Content-Based Image Retrieval methods since it is a lot easier to search for specific images using Hamming distance. Hamming distance between two-bit strings that are equal length is the number of positions where corresponding bits are different, thus the images that are most like one another have the lowest Hamming distance. 

## 2. Algorithms
**A. MNIST Dataset Barcode Generation**

The radon barcode generation algorithm works by creating projections for the angles 0, 45, 90 and 180 degrees for the chosen image. These projections are created and for this array a threshold mean is found. Where after, it is binarized to 1’s and 0’s where if the number were larger than the mean it would be set to 1 and 0 otherwise. After, the binarization of this array it becomes appended to the RBC array. After, the addition of this array the while loop will create a new angle through θ ← θ + 180/nθ. This will iterate through depending on the number of projections chosen, for this specific algorithm the while loop will run 4 times. Finally ending with a binary array with the dimension size of 112 x 1. This array can be reduced in size, with approximately seven digits on either size to retain accuracy. Ultimately, our final barcode remained at 112 x 1 due to the small dataset size. But for a larger dataset, the algorithm run time would decrease with a smaller binary array comparison. 
Radon projections is the staple of the algorithm 1, where it focuses on finding the sum of an array in specific angles. For 4 projections, as previously state it will occur at 0, 45, 90 and 180. The figure below showcases, a simple implementation of radon projections for a 3 x 3 array. In our specific case, we will be working with a 28 x 28 down sampling size. Which ultimately means, that our array will be far larger. Our radon projections per angle will have a 28 x 1.

**B. Radon Barcode Comparison Using Hamming Distance**

Similarity and error detection are generally found by calculating the frequency of dissimilarity between two data sets. These principles are applied when calculating Hamming Distance. It being a metric for comparing two binary datasets of equal length, Hamming Distance is the number of positions in which the two bits are different. In our application Hamming Distance is fundamentally calculated by comparing the least significant bit in each RBC, if the values differ; a value is added to the counter. Then the least significant bit is popped from each RBC and a Boolean false is appended to each RBC, shifting them to the right. These orders of operations are performed until a Boolean false value is present in each index of each RBC.
